    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "  I will collect data (via Beautiful Soup) consisting of feuds, participants, durations, and fan ratings of professional wrestling matches from CAGEMATCH.net, an online database of pro wrestling information from across many promotions (including WWE, AEW, New Japan, and many more).\n",
    "  I will then use a regression model, with MSE as my metric, to discover what features of a feud make for the strongest ratings by CAGEMATCH.net users.  With this done, I will use my model to book a three-month season of professional wrestling, taking in to account not repeating feuds to keep viewer's interest.\n",

    "  - Web scraping is difficult!  Most of my time is likely going to be spent here.\n",
    "  - Cagematch.net is a site mostly marketed towards German and German-speaking users.  While much of the site is in English, this does affect the demographic of the audience.  "
